If the program(s) screw up or terminate halfway, look at the most recent time'd backup folder and echo it's name into time.txt (as long as time2.txt exists, it's contents don't matter). After that, delete the failed backup folder and backup log after looking at them, making sure to figure out the problem(s) before deleting. The program will not work if the directory it's trying to create already exists as a folder/file.
